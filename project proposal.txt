For my Term Project I'm working on a rhythm game that randomly generates circles on screen that the player has to press in time. Similar to osu!, but instead of user-created maps, I intend to make the maps randomly made by the computer, which are placed according to the beat of the music. In the end I want to allow the player to import their own audio, but as I'm not too familiar with audio file I/O, this is likely going to be an addition at the end, if there is time.

I plan on using the following modules:
	Pygame
	Librosa (for audio analysis, primarily beat detection)

Using Librosa, I will get the times for each beat in a given song. Then I will incorporating this into pygame, whereby a beat will be generated every at said times.

Some additional features:
	Combo mechanic, where the more consecutive notes hit, the higher the score multiplier
	Increasing difficulty, the more consecutive notes hit, the harder the game
	Ability for user to input their own music files
