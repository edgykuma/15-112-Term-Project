    - working combo system (with multipliers for score)
    - added SFX when a beat is hit or missed
    - allowed keypresses of 'z' and 'x' to count for hitting beats
- created text sprite class and sound class
    - also created button class, but is unused as of now
- aesthetic changes:

    - beat color randomized every 4 beats (instead of every beat)
    - beats now have numbers on them, to make clear to player what order to hit them in
    - made the background black, with white outlines (easier on the eyes)
    - text appears showing the score gained when beat is hit or missed
    - score and combo meters in the corners
